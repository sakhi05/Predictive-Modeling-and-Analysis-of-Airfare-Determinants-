# Predictive Modeling and Analysis of Airfare Determinants

## 📊 Overview

This project applies data mining and predictive analytics techniques to analyze the key determinants of airfare pricing. Using a real-world dataset, we built regression models to identify and quantify the most influential factors affecting airfare, providing actionable insights for business and data analysts in the airline industry.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Data Exploration & Cleaning: Comprehensive preprocessing of airfare and demographic data.
- Feature Engineering: Identification and transformation of relevant variables (e.g., distance, airline, income, population).
- Predictive Modeling: Regression analysis to predict airfare based on multiple determinants.
- Model Evaluation: Performance measured using RMSE and prediction confidence.
- Business Insights: Quantitative ranking of influencer contributions to airfare, supporting data-driven decision-making.

## 🏆 Results

- Top Influencers: Distance, airline (SW), vacation, coupon usage, and destination population are the most significant predictors of airfare.
- Model Performance: Achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 25.16 and a prediction confidence of 95.5%.
- Actionable Insights: The analysis enables airlines and travel agencies to optimize pricing strategies and understand market dynamics.
